Ingredients
2 tbsp vegetable oil or other high heat oil
1 pound beef sirloin cut into thin strips, see note
2 cups broccoli fresh florets
1 red bell pepper cut into thin strips
2 large carrots peeled and cut into thin strips
1 small zucchini thinly sliced
2 green onions thinly sliced
1 tsp garlic minced
1/2 tsp ginger freshly grated
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
2 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp fish sauce
2 tbsp sesame seeds toasted

Instructions
Throughout entire recipe, do not overcrowd your wok. You're better off cooking in small batches,
setting aside, and combining everything at the end. You want everything to have a nice sear on it 
but not be soggy and overly cooked.

Ensure meat and all vegetables are cut prior to cooking.

raw vegetables on cutting board for Beef Stir Fry recipe
Heat vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet over high heat. When oil is near it's smoking point, 
cook and stir beef until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. It will continue cooking later, so it doesn't 
need to be fully cooked at this point. You just want a nice sear on it.

Transfer beef to a plate. Add broccoli, bell pepper, carrots, zucchini, and green onion to the 
center of the wok. Cook and stir vegetables for 2 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, and red pepper 
flakes and stir well.

Recipe Notes
Slicing meat that is partially frozen or very cold is easiest. Slice against the grain to get the 
most tender bite.
